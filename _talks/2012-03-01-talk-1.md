**Part I: Loads and crack growth**

The structural integrity of weld joints that transfer the core load to the main vessel supports are important for thesafety of the sodium cooled fast breeder reactor.  In this work we determined fatigue crack growth parameters anddeveloped a time-dependent fatigue reliability model of these welds that incorporates uncertainties in loading historiestypically found in an Indian FBR, fracture strength and experimentally determined crack growth parameters.

**Part II: Role of inspection**

In order to ensure that fatigue crack growth remains within acceptable limits, the welds are subject to pre-service aswell as in-service inspections.  In this work we characterized uncertainties in the in-service inspection model, updatedthe  crack-size  based  on  inspection  results,  and  showed  how  the  predicted  time-dependent  reliability  can  be  usedas  an  aid  to  decision  making.   Parametric  studies  are  conducted  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  initial  and  in-serviceinspections
