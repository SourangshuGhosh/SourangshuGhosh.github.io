The structural integrity of weld joints that transfer the core load to the main vessel supports is important for the safety of the sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor. In order to ensure that fatigue crack growth remains within acceptable limits, the welds are subject to pre-service as well as in-service inspections.  In this work, we characterized uncertainties in the in-service inspection model, updated the crack size based on inspection results,  and showed how the predicted time-dependent reliability can be used as an aid to decision making.  Parametric  studies  are  conducted  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  initial and in-service inspections
