A structural system may fail in several possible modes, thus finding the exact reliability of the structure is therefore not possible always. To get an estimate of the system reliability we need upper and lower bounds to the reliability. For computation of bi-order system reliabilities the most common formula is one that is known as Ditlevsen Bound. This paper presents a better lower bound than Ditlevsen bound using techniques proposed by other authors like Zhang.
