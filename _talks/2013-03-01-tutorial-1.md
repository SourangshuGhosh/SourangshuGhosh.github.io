The structural integrity of weld joints that transfer the core load to the main vessel supports are important for thesafety of the sodium cooled fast breeder reactor.  In this work we determined fatigue crack growth parameters anddeveloped a time-dependent fatigue reliability model of these welds that incorporates uncertainties in loading historiestypically found in an Indian FBR, fracture strength and experimentally determined crack growth parameters
