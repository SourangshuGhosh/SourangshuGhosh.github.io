This paper presents a stochastic model of fatigue-induced crack propagation in stressed metallic structures subjected to cyclic loads. The uncertainties that govern the fatigue crack propagation like material properties, environmental conditions and cyclic mechanical loads are mostly random in nature. Stochastic processes thus provide us with an excellent framework to model and predict the crack propagation.
