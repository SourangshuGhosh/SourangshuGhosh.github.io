The structural integrity of weld joints that transfer the core load to the main vessel supports is important for the safety of the sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor.  In this work we determined fatigue crack growth parameters and developed a time-dependent fatigue reliability model of these welds that incorporates uncertainties in loading histories typically found in an Indian FBR, fracture strength, and experimentally determined crack growth parameters
