Syllabus
======

The objective of the course is to apprise the students about the basics of the Finite Element Technique, a numerical tool for the solution of different classes of problems in solid
mechanics. Different application areas will be dealt with after introducing the basic aspects of the method. However, major emphasis will be on the solution of problems related to Civil Engineering. It is intended to cover the analysis methodologies for 1-D, 2-D and 3-D problems with the advantages and disadvantages clearly spelt out. It is expected that once the students are exposed to the course, they will be in a position to develop computer codes for any physical problem using the Finite Element technique. The target audience of the course is the Post Graduate / Final year Undergraduate students from areas such as Civil, Mechanical, Aerospace, Naval Architecture etc.
