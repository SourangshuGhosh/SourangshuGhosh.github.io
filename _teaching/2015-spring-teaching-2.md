Teacher Assistant in the course of Stochastic Structural Dynamics.

Syllabus
======

This course is mainly focused to explain the theories and applications of reliability analysis of structural systems having uncertainty and/or exposed to random environment. The course introduces basic concepts of probability theory at the beginning which is followed by the Level-2 reliability methods. The readers are then introduced to the intricacies of Monte-Carlo simulation and its advanced versions for variance reduction and subset simulation. The treatment of implicit limit states using RSM and recently developed SRSM techniques are explained separately with examples. With these knowledge of reliability analysis in hand, the course then aims to explain the applications of these methods for code calibrations and reliability analysis under multiple failure modes (i.e. system reliability). The time varying reliability analysis and reliability based optimization are then explained with example cases. A brief introduction of stochastic finite element is then provided. Finally, the course ends with example cases for reliability analysis of complex real life structures using MATLAB and commercially available software for finite element analysis like ANSYS in batch mode. The course will help the final year undergraduate students and/or post graduate students to develop their skills to take this subject for further research. As major emphasis is given to the applications, this course will also help the practicing engineers to use these advanced design concepts in their profession.
