I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in Civil Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur pursuing a major degree in Civil Engineering and a minor degree in Mathematics and Computing. I am supervised in Bachelor's and Master's Thesis by [Prof.Baidurya Bhattacharya](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~baidurya/) . I am a member of Structural Reliability Research Facility, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My broad area of interest is Discrete Mathematics especially Number Theory. I am currently working on Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and Collatz Conjecture.  In the future I want to work in a number of areas of analytic number theory like the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture, the Waring problem, and the Riemann hypothesis.

Besides my work on Discrete Mathematics, I have also worked on in the Time Dependent Reliability of Weld Joints of Nuclear Power Plants in collaboration with [IGCAR Kalpakkam](http://www.igcar.gov.in/), structural reliability of coherent systems under the supervision of Prof. Baidurya Bhattacharya in my undergraduate bachelor's thesis of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur.  

I have developed a passion for writing quality research papers. I have written quite a few articles, several of which are published/accepted in international Journals which can be found at my [Google Scholar Account](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=najOWs8AAAAJ&hl=en),[Researchgate Account](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sourangshu-Ghosh-2) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/ghosh_s_16.html). 

When I am not working, I like to play chess and violin. I am trained in violin in indian classical musical style.
